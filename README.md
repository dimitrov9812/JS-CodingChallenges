# JS-CodingChallenges

# I made some different types of games to test my gained knowledge and add some fun projects to my portfolio
  ## AgeInDays
    * It get the user age and displays it in days.
  ## AngryWebSite
     I got an idea to make a website wich would only make the user angry, I know there was no point of doing it but i thought that it will be fun to test what i have learned a bit differently.
    The website has 6 fields which do the opossite what they are meant to be:
      * Caclulator wich calculates correct but not the desired action selected (for example when a user chooses add it multiplies the two numbers).
      * It has a box with some buttons wich change the background in a different ways (most of them make it ugly and one of them restores it).
      * One of the boxes (the one with the picture) on mouse hover changes possition randomly and runs from you all the time.
      * It has the rock, paper, scissors game but works the opposite way (rock wins agains paper).
      * Do you like my website switch wich of course insists on pressing 'Yes'.
      * The last one is the one that actually work is the google search.
      * It has some other functions that will make you angry (messed up buttons, not working ones and mixed links).
    The purpose of the non usual website:
      * I think that if you know how to make something work and in the wrong way and still be fun you can make it work right.
   ## BlackJack
    * A simple game of BlackJack 
    * You play agains a computer wich after your turn is ready starts collecting cards for himself and desides weather to stop or not.
    * After the computer is ready the to scores are being calclulated and the winner is being displayed
    * If you win you get a winning message and the winning sound 
    * If you loose you get the loosing message and the loosing sound
    * There is a table that keeps track of your games
  ## RandomButtonColor
    * Simple app that gives the button random colors.
    * It always remembers what was their original color and can revert to it.
  ## RockPaperScissorsGame
    * Simple traditional rock, paper, scissors game.
    * This functions normally unlike in the 'Angry Website'.
    * You pick you choise and it displays on the left and in the right you get the Pc's choice and after that a winner is being choosed.
 ## SpiderGenerator
    * App that on button click add spider gif images on the screen.
    * The other button clears them.
    * I learned dom manipulating images and using flexboxes when div's are being added dynamically.
 ## NoDiceBoardGame
    * The idea of the game first came in 2020 Plovdiv Game Jam and me and my team decided to make it on Unity and presented it. I wanted to try and make the same game or at least something simmilar but played in the browser.
    * I started and whithin a couple of days i managed to make it work almost the same.
    * It starts with you choosing how many players you want to play with (2-4 players).
    * Then you choose name and image for each of the players and press the start button.
    * After the button press you see the map and the 4 action buttons which you can choose from.
    * This is very much like a board game but uses human interactions (doing challenges in order to move forward). Of course complete trust between players is required.
          * The "Challenge" button gives the player on turn a challenge and if he does it and everyone aprooves he moves with 3 tiles.
          * The "Safe" button gives the player on turn opportunity to move one tile forward.
          * The "Hook" button gives the player opportunity to write other player's name and he is being hooked 2 tiles back but you don't move that turn
          * The "Risky" button is a very risky button wich can move you 3 tiles forward but if you are unlucky you can move 3 tiles backwards or the third opption wich is not that bad - not to move at all (skip turn).
     * The player who reaches the end wins.
     * The 4 buttons are meant to make the players think and build their strategy through the 4 options of momevent.
  ## What have i learned from all those projects
     * A lot of improvement in my work with arrays
     * Fully manipulating DOM objects
     * Different types of animations tested 
     * In some projects i managed to simulate a pc players wich makes the game available to play with a single person on it's own
     * Changing player names and pictures was a bit tricky at the beggining but i managed to do it.
     * Use of sound
     * Changing player turns and with the turns a lot of HTML elements change as well.
